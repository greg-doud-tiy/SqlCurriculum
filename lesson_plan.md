## Lesson Plan

### Duration

15 Minutes 

### Instructor Preparation

Review the following links:

  - Tables: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)
  - Rows: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_(database)
  - Columns: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)

### Lesson

Students that have not studied databases will not be familiar with the terms. Be ready to explain them in detail. The purpose of the lesson is to make sure students understand that a table is a collection of one type of data that is typically described as a noun or a thing. Rows are all the attributes of one particular thing and the columns are the individual attributes being kept on each thing. Tables, rows, and columns allow modeling of real work objects.

#### Open / Pre-lesson Activity

Ask the class to help create one list of all everyone's friend. Just one list. Ask what to call the list. Ask what attributes they want to collect to help identify each friend. Use a grid on a whileboard to begin gathering the data. Make sure to lable the column headings. Limit the number of columns to four or five.

#### Lecture

Ask the students about keeping track of the employees at their company so they can produce reports and paychecks.

It is likely a table of employees exists. All current employees will exist in the table. Previous employees may also exist in the table. But this table will never hold customers of the company. Customers will be stored in a different table. Every table can hold only one type of data.

A table can have zero or more rows of data. A row is all the data about a single instance of data. For example, for employees, each row will be all the company knows about each employee. It will include things like name, address, start date, job, etc.

A row is made of of one or more columns. A column is one piece of data, must have a unique name within the table and is limited to a single type of data. The type could be a string or a number, but whichever one is chosen, all rows have the same type of data stored in the same column.

#### Close / Post-lesson Activity

Explain that tables, rows, and columns allow data to be stored, maintained and retrieved easily. The collection of data in tables is a strategic asset of companies.
